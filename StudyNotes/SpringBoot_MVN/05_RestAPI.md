# 📌 Overview

REST API (Representational State Transfer) is an **architectural style** used to design scalable web services.

👉 In simple terms:
* A REST API allows a **client (frontend/mobile)** to communicate with a **server (backend)** using HTTP.
* Uses HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.
* Client sends requests to server endpoints (URLs).
* Server returns responses such as JSON, XML, HTML, or images.
* Maps HTTP methods to CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
 
---

# 🧠 What is REST?

REST is NOT a protocol like HTTP.
It is a **set of design rules (constraints)**.

👉 Core idea:

* Everything is treated as a **resource**
* Each resource has a **unique URI**

Example:

```text id="e9k3lm"
/users        → collection
/users/1      → specific resource
```

👉 Representation:

* Data is usually sent in **JSON format**

---

# ⚙️ REST Principles (Constraints)

## 1. Stateless (Most Important)

👉 Server does NOT remember previous requests.

Example:

* Request 1: Login
* Request 2: Get user data

👉 Server should not rely on request 1.

✔️ Why important?

* Easier scaling
* No session management overhead

---

## 2. Client-Server Separation

👉 Frontend and backend are independent.

✔️ Benefits:

* Frontend can change without backend changes
* Better scalability

---

## 3. Cacheable

👉 Responses should indicate if they can be cached.

✔️ Benefits:

* Faster performance
* Reduced server load

---

## 4. Uniform Interface

👉 Standard way of interacting:

* HTTP methods
* URIs
* Status codes

---

## 5. Layered System

👉 Multiple layers can exist:

* API Gateway
* Load Balancer

Client doesn’t know actual backend.

---

# 🌍 HTTP Methods (Deep Dive)

## 🔹 GET

👉 Retrieve data

✔️ Characteristics:

* Safe (no data change)
* Idempotent

Example:

```http id="e1k8sd"
GET /users/1
```

---

## 🔹 POST

👉 Create new resource

✔️ Not idempotent
Multiple calls → multiple records

---

## 🔹 PUT

👉 Replace entire resource

Example:

```http id="f9k3ls"
PUT /users/1
```

✔️ Idempotent
Same request → same result

---

## 🔹 PATCH

👉 Partial update

Example:

```http id="v7k2mz"
PATCH /users/1
{
  "name": "New Name"
}
```

---

## 🔹 DELETE

👉 Remove resource

✔️ Idempotent
Deleting again won’t change result

---

# 📦 HTTP Status Codes (Detailed)

## ✅ 2xx Success

* 200 OK → Success
* 201 Created → Resource created
* 204 No Content → Success but no body

---

## ⚠️ 4xx Client Errors

* 400 → Bad request (invalid input)
* 401 → Not authenticated
* 403 → Forbidden (no permission)
* 404 → Resource not found

---

## ❌ 5xx Server Errors

* 500 → Internal error
* 503 → Service unavailable

---

# 🔗 URI Design Best Practices

## ✅ Good Design

```text id="r8k2pw"
/users
/users/1
/users/1/orders
```

✔️ Use nouns
✔️ Use hierarchy

---

## ❌ Bad Design

```text id="t7m3kl"
/getUser
/createOrder
```

👉 REST is about **resources, not actions**

---

# 📥 Request & Response Structure

## Request Example

```http id="z9k3lm"
POST /users
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "John",
  "email": "john@mail.com"
}
```

---

## Response Example

```json id="y8k2pl"
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "John",
  "email": "john@mail.com"
}
```

---

## Headers (Important)

* Content-Type
* Authorization
* Accept

---

# 🔄 Idempotency (Very Important)

👉 Definition:
Making the same request multiple times produces the same result.

## Examples:

* GET → Always same result
* PUT → Replace same data
* DELETE → Already deleted → no change

## Not Idempotent:

* POST → Creates new resource each time

---

# 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

## Authentication (Who are you?)

* Username/password
* Token

## Authorization (What can you do?)

* Role-based access

---

## Common Methods:

### 🔹 JWT

* Stateless
* Token-based

### 🔹 OAuth2

* Used for third-party login (Google, Facebook)

---

# 📊 Versioning Strategies

## URI Versioning

```text id="q3k8ls"
/v1/users
/v2/users
```

✔️ Easy to understand

---

## Header Versioning

```http id="x8m2pz"
Accept: application/vnd.v1+json
```

✔️ Cleaner but harder to manage

---

# ⚡ Caching (Performance Optimization)

## Why caching?

* Reduce DB calls
* Improve speed

## Headers:

```http id="n3k9dl"
Cache-Control: max-age=3600
ETag: "abc123"
```

👉 ETag helps detect changes

---

# 🚨 Error Handling (Best Practices)

## Standard Error Response

```json id="p9k3ls"
{
  "timestamp": "2026-04-11",
  "status": 400,
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "message": "Invalid input"
}
```

✔️ Always consistent format
✔️ Never expose internal errors

---

# 🔍 REST vs SOAP

| Feature     | REST          | SOAP     |
| ----------- | ------------- | -------- |
| Style       | Architectural | Protocol |
| Data        | JSON          | XML      |
| Speed       | Fast          | Slow     |
| Flexibility | High          | Low      |

---

# 🧠 HATEOAS (Advanced)

👉 API provides navigation links

```json id="z2k8lm"
{
  "id": 1,
  "_links": {
    "self": "/users/1",
    "orders": "/users/1/orders"
  }
}
```

👉 Helps dynamic API navigation

---

# ⚙️ REST in Spring Boot

```java id="p8k3ls"
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/users")
public class UserController {

    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public String getUser(@PathVariable int id) {
        return "User " + id;
    }

    @PostMapping
    public String createUser() {
        return "User created";
    }
}
```

👉 Maps HTTP requests to Java methods
